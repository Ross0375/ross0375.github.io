        <img title="Me" src="images/adison_rossiter.jpg" alt="Picture of Adison Rossiter">
        <p>
            I am an Algonquin College student taking the <a href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/mediaanddesign/program/interactive-media-design/" class="orange-link">IMD</a> Program.
            I have previously attended a music program at Humber College for one year.
            After that one year program I took a year off and spent my time working in a kitchen and almost went to culinary school, 
            it was when we went into quarantine which made realize that I don't want to be slaving away in a kitchen for all my life so I took a gamble and joined this program.
