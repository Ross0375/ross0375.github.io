<h1>YOU. ME. GAS STATION.</h1>
<p>What are we getting for dinner?<br>
<strong>Sushi of course.</strong> Uh oh, there was a roofie inside of our gas station sushi,<br>
we black out and wake up in a sewer. We're surrounded by fish; <i><b>horny fish.</b></i><br>
You know what <i>that</i> means.<br>
<h2>Fish orgy,</h2>
the stench draws in a bear. What are we gonna do?
<p style="font-size:30px"><i>We're gonna fight it.</i></p>
<p style="font-size:10px">BEAR FIGHT.</p>
<p style="font-size:15px"> BEAR HANDED.</p>
<p style="font-size:25px"> BEAR <i>naked?</i> </p>
<p>oh yes, <b><i>please.</i></b></p>
<p>We befriend the bear after we beat it in a brawl.<br>
then we ride into a chuck-e-cheese, dance dance revolution. </p>
<p>REVOLUTION?</p> 
<p>OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT?</p> 
<p><i><b>uh, I think so.</b></i></p>
<p>Next thing you know, i'm reincarnated as <b>Jesus Christ.</b><br>
Then i turn into a jet, fly into the sun, black out again, wake up, do a bump,<br>
white out which i didn't know you could do, then i smoked a <span class="highlight">joint.</span><br>
Greened-out, then i turned into the sun. uh oh, looks like the meth is kicking in.</p>
