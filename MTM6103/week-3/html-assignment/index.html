        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an Algonquin College student taking the <abbr title ="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> Program. I have previously attended a music program at Humber College for one year. After that one year program I took a year off and spent my time working in a kitchen and almost went to culinary school, it was when we went into quarantine which made realize that I don't want to be slaving away in a kitchen for all my life so I took a gamble and joined this program.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love learning about anything, I can play over 10 instruments with realatively good proficiency. I love cooking outside of work and sharing this food with my friends. I also have interests in home brewing beer and cannabis cultivation. Besides music and all that other stuff I enjoy video games and spending time with people whenever I can. (sadly haven't been able to do this recently with the whole pandemic stuff)
