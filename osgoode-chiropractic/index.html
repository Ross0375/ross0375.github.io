                            <p>I graduated from Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) in 1996 and have been treating conditions such as: low back pain, mid-back pain, neckpain, sciatica, headaches, migraines, sprains and strains and improving flexibility and posture for approximately 20 years.</p>
                            <p>The more I practiced, the more I realized health and wellness was much more than just the physical.</p>
                            <p>I learned of Reconnective Healing on the Dr.Oz show by chiropractor, Dr. Eric Pearl.  It is a revolutionary new form of healing returning the body to anoptimal state of balance and vibration and studies show that bio-photonic light emitted from our cells is increased with this work.</p>
                            <p>From world-wide accounts, most illnesses and health conditions have responded to Reconnective Healing such as: anxiety/depression, arthritis, epilepsy,cerebral palsy, cancer, heart disease, vision loss, hearing loss, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis(MS), autism, and ADHD.</p>

                            <p>While in nursing school, I began to have very bad migraines that were causing me to miss my hospital rotations.  That led me to see a Chiropractor andthe results were amazing.  This opened my eyes to a whole other world of drug-free health care and eventually brought me to chiropractic school.
                            Upon completing my nursing studies at the University of Ottawa, I attended Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC ) in Toronto.  While I studiedchiropractic, I also studied various soft tissue and myofascial therapies as well as acupuncture.</p>
                            <p>I have a keen interest in sports related injuries however I believe that everyone can benefit from chiropractic care.  I have treated everyone in allstages in life including the newborn who experienced a very rough delivery, to the athlete recovering from labrum surgery in his shoulder, to the 107 yearold who simply wanted to continue to be well.</p>
                            <p>On a personal note, I am very happily married and blessed with a daughter and son. Sports has always been part of my upbringing and I continue toparticipate in many activities to this day whether it be playing basketball, tennis, going for a run or hopping on my bike for a ride.</p>
