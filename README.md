~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Work Log~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to my portfolio, I will be keeping this log of all issues I faced and anything that goes wrong.
Hopefully there'll be less bs then the last project considering this is a much simpler design, just a lot more pages.
Aligning the need to reach me section on the about page is giving me troubles, currently trying to flex it down.
Tried using justify-self/align-self, that didn't work, turns out the simple way is the easiest, just use margin-top: auto; (still used flex box though)
The works page is pretty simple, just using grids, easy to change later on for other responsive states.
Finished one of the works pages, ready to be transferred to all other works pages, this part is pretty simple.
Might add a return button to the bottom of these pages instead of the top just because it would probably be more convenient to have them at the bottom.
I have just finished the responsive states (for the most part, may require editing in the future once all the body copy is complete) Now I am turning my attention to the body copy to get that out of the way.
After finishing the body copy I started work on the animation and found a way simpler way then using animate.css classes, I can just use css itself to automatically apply the animations I need, way easier.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Challenges~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This project was certainly less ambitious then my midterm, mainly due to the fact that those looking at my portfolio probably don't want to see as crazty of a design. The main struggles I faced with this project was mostly super minor things like text acting weird and spacing issues. These issues only caused probably an hour or two of delay (way lessthen the midterm where I had multiple cases of mystery gaps and fitting images over eachother) One thing I learned a lot about was taking the border pixels into account in order to get the page to fit exactly onto the screen, without any scrolls or gaps. I also learned to not use animate css and instead automate the application of the animations. Without this I would have to go to every single page and add a lot of classes to every single section on the page, making it stupidly redundent. I really enjoyed the calmer, less rage inducing, work on this assignment.

FINAL NOTE WHILE VALIDATING
Can you please help in the marking explain or show why the calc function with a variable in it shows up as a parse error, it is literally driving me crazy and lost me marks on the last assignment and will lose me marks on this assignment. I have looked through multiple pages on google and have not found any resource explaining why it shows an error other than "Oh jujst ignore W3C markup is stupid anyways". It would be greatly appreciated and help me become more proficient. Thanks for the great semester!
