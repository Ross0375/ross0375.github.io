~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Work Log~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Welcome to my portfolio, I will be keeping this log of all issues I faced and anything that goes wrong.
Hopefully there'll be less bs then the last project considering this is a much simpler design, just a lot more pages.
Aligning the need to reach me section on the about page is giving me troubles, currently trying to flex it down.
Tried using justify-self/align-self, that didn't work, turns out the simple way is the easiest, just use margin-top: auto; (still used flex box though)
The works page is pretty simple, just using grids, easy to change later on for other responsive states, I just had an idea though, if I included bootstrap I could do carousels for the images just to rotate through all of them on the main works page. [IMPORTANT] REMEMBER TO DO THIS LATER. (gonna make a todo list now)
Just had the idea to add a dropdown menu using the bootstrap layout, might be a good idea. [IMPORTANT]
Finished one of the works pages, ready to be transferred to all other works pages, this part is pretty simple.
Might add a return button to the bottom of these pages instead of the top just because it would probably be more convenient to have them at the bottom.
I have just finished the responsive states (for the most part, may require editing in the future once all the body copy is complete) Now I am turning my attention to the body copy to get that out of the way.
