        <p>One thing I did over the break was start selling stickers of my art online! Printed locally and packaged by hand, and thankfully I've made my money back already! My next step is to take the money earned and spend it on screen printing supplies. I also worked on some music projects I have going on with some friends. (Used to study Jazz before coming to this program)</p>
